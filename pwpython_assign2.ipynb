It is used to represent text and is enclosed within either single quotes ('...'), double quotes (\"...\"), or triple quotes ('''...''' or \"\"\"...\"\"\").

        "- Ans :\n",
        "- Order matters : Lists maintain insertion order prefered over list when the order of the elements is important.\n",
        "- Storing items without explicit labels (keys): Lists are great for homogeneous collections like [ 1, 2, 3 ],  [ 'apple', 'banana' ]. where as dictionary stored as key-value pairs.\n",
        "- Durig less memory availability :Lists are more memory-efficient than dictionaries for small collections. Dictionaries require more memory, as they store keys along with values, unlike lists.\n",
        "- List prefered when order based operation are important like sorting, appending or inserting at a perticular index.\n",
        "-List prefered when data doesnt require a mapping relationship. If you just have values without needing a label/identifier, a list is simpler.\n",
        "- List prefered while performing indexed based access: Lists are faster for index-based access, as retrieving an element by index takes O(1), whereas dictionary lookups require computing a hash.\n",

        "19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval ?\n",
        "- Dictionaries are conceptually unordered because their structure is based on hashing, not sequence. They store elements as key-value pairs based on the hash of the key, not the order of entry. This allows O(1) average-case time complexity for lookups, inserts, and deletes.\n",
        "- Hash table enables the faster access of the value using the key. When we access a value with key, It computes the hash of 'key' Jumps directly to the location in memory (bucket) where the value is stored.\n",
        "-Hence for key-based lookups, dictionaries are one of the fastest data structures in Python."

        "- Ans : In terms of data retrieval, a dictionary excels at fast lookups by key, while a list is better suited for sequential access by index. Dictionaries use a hash-based approach, allowing for nearly instantaneous retrieval of a value when the key is known, whereas lists require traversing the list sequentially until the desired element is found.\n",
        "- List retrieve elements by their numerical index within the list. For example, my_list[2] would access the third element in the list. Where as Dictionaries retrieve elements by their associated key. For example, my_dictionary[\"name\"] would retrieve the value associated with the key \"name\".\n",
        "- Data retrieval time is directly proportional in Lists as element need to be checked one by one bigger data increases the time of retrieval where as dictionaries data retrieval time is depends on the hash table and is very fast due to the use of a hash table.\n",
        "- In List Accessing an element by index is typically a very fast operation and in Dictionary accessing an element by key is typically a very fast operation."
